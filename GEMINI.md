## Gemini Project Analysis: laconicd.github.io

### Project Overview

This project is a personal blog created with the **Zola** static site generator. The blog focuses on topics like Rust, Zola, and modern web development. It is styled with **Tailwind CSS** and the **DaisyUI** component library, and features client-side search functionality powered by **Fuse.js**. The project is set up to use **Deno** for managing scripts and dependencies.

### Key Technologies

*   **Static Site Generator**: Zola
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with the DaisyUI and Typography plugins
*   **Client-side Search**: Fuse.js
*   **Scripting/Dependencies**: Deno
*   **Deployment**: GitHub Actions to GitHub Pages

### Building and Running

The project uses Deno's task runner to manage build and development commands.

*   **Development Server**:
    To run the local development server, which will automatically rebuild the site on changes, use the following command:
    ```bash
    deno task dev
    ```
    This will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`.

*   **Production Build**:
    To build the static site for production, use the following command:
    ```bash
    deno task prd
    ```
    This will generate the static files in the `public` directory.

### Development Conventions

*   **Content**: Blog posts are written in Markdown and located in the `content/posts` directory.
*   **Styling**: All styling is managed through Tailwind CSS. The main CSS file is `assets/tailwind.css`, which is compiled to `static/styles.css` during the build process.
*   **Templates**: The HTML structure is defined using Zola's Tera templating engine. The base template is `templates/base.html`, and various partials are included from the `templates/partials` directory.
*   **Search**: The client-side search is implemented in `scripts/fuse.ts`. It uses a search index generated by Zola during the build process.
*   **Deployment**: The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages on every push to the `main` branch, as defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
