Building my first static site with Zola has been an amazing experience. The speed and simplicity of writing content in Markdown, combined with Zola's powerful templating engine, makes it a joy to work with.

This post will delve into some of the key features I found most useful, such as:
-   **Markdown-first approach**: How easy it is to focus on content.
-   **Tera templating**: Customizing the look and feel.
-   **Built-in features**: RSS feeds, sitemaps, and more.

Stay tuned for more updates on my Zola journey!
