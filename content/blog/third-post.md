Tailwind CSS has quickly become my go-to framework for styling web applications. Its utility-first approach allows for rapid UI development without ever leaving your HTML.

In this post, I'll share my initial thoughts and experiences:
-   **The utility-first paradigm**: Why it's so powerful.
-   **Customization**: Tailoring Tailwind to your design system.
-   **Integration with Zola**: How to get them working together seamlessly.

It took some getting used to, but now I can't imagine going back to traditional CSS.
