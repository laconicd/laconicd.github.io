The web development landscape is constantly evolving. As we move further into 2025, several trends are shaping the future of how we build for the web.

Here are a few that have caught my attention:
-   **AI-powered development tools**: From code generation to intelligent debugging.
-   **Further rise of WebAssembly**: Bringing high-performance applications to the browser.
-   **Enhanced privacy features**: A growing focus on user data protection.
-   **Sustainable web design**: Optimizing for energy efficiency.

It's an exciting time to be a web developer!
