# Hello, I'm a Developer 👋

Welcome to my personal blog. I am a software engineer passionate about building elegant solutions to complex problems.

## What I Do

I specialize in modern web technologies and love exploring new frameworks and tools. My core interests include:

- **Frontend Development**: Crafting beautiful and performant user interfaces with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
- **System Architecture**: Designing scalable and maintainable systems.
- **Open Source**: Contributing to the community and learning from others.

## About This Blog

This site is built using **Zola**, a fast static site generator written in Rust. I use this space to document my
learning journey, share technical tutorials, and post about my personal projects.

## Get In Touch

I'm always open to discussing new projects, creative ideas, or opportunities to be part of your visions. Feel free to
reach out to me!
