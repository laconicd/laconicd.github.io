Digital design is undergoing a renaissance. After years of brutalist minimalism
and flat interfaces, we are seeing a return to the **Editorial Aesthetic**.

In this article, we'll explore how to balance negative space with bold serif
headlines to create a reading experience that feels both nostalgic and
futuristic.

## The Rhythm of the Page

A magazine isn't just a list of articles; it's a journey. The way a reader's eye
moves across a spread is carefully choreographed through typography and grid
alignment.

<div class="pull-quote">
  The white space is as important as the ink. It gives the content room to breathe.
</div>

When we design for the web, we often forget this rhythm. We stack elements
vertically and call it a day. But by using CSS Grid and logical properties, we
can recreate the asymmetrical beauty of a printed page.

### Logical Properties in Practice

Using `inline-size` instead of `width` and `block-size` instead of `height`
ensures that our layouts remain robust across different writing modes and
locales. This is the foundation of a truly global editorial system.
