# Test Post 1 - General

This post demonstrates syntax highlighting for **text/general** using **Zola**.

```text
Hello World!
This is a plain text code block.
It doesn't have any specific language syntax.
But it still benefits from the 'pre' and 'code' styling.

Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
```

Welcome to the blog! This is the first test post in our series of 20 posts.
Each post is designed to test different aspects of the Zola static site generator, including:

1.  Markdown rendering
2.  Syntax highlighting
3.  Taxonomies (Categories and Tags)
4.  SPA navigation and transitions
```
