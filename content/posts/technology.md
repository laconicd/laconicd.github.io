Speed is the ultimate user experience. In an age of bloated web frameworks, Zola
offers a refreshing return to simplicity.

## Performance as Design

### Why Zola?

Zola is written in Rust, which means it's incredibly fast. For a magazine with
hundreds of articles and high-resolution images, this performance is crucial.
