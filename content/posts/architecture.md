The philosophy of minimalism in architecture is more than just removing walls; it's about the essential nature of space and light.

Mies famously said, "Less is more." His work at the Barcelona Pavilion demonstrates how materials like marble and glass can define space without cluttering it.

### The Modern Interface

Just as Mies used a steel grid to provide structure to open plans, we use the **Blueprint Engine** to provide a resilient framework for our digital content.

1. **Clarity:** Every element must have a purpose.
2. **Precision:** Alignment is the key to professionalism.
3. **Materials:** In digital design, our materials are typography and color.
